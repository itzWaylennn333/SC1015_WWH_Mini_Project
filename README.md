# Fraudulent_Job_Postings_Classification
## Pratical Motivation 
The significant loss of $135.7 million to job scams in Singapore during 2023 is a concerning issue, particularly for university students who are soon entering the workforce. Singapore's status as an international business hub attracts job seekers from diverse backgrounds, including these students. However, the prevalence of fraudulent job schemes has left them deeply worried about their prospects. Our objective is to address and mitigate the impact of job scams.
## The Dataset
The dataset of real and fake job postings is from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction 
## Problem Formulation
Our aim is to build a classifier using machine learning models to indentify fraudulent and non-fraudulent jobs.

After filtering irrelevant variables, we will be using three model to analyze textual data, and a model to analyze categorical data. Among three models that classify textual data, we will be deciding the most effective model using accuracy and time metrics.
